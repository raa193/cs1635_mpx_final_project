# CS1635 MPX: Flight Tracker #
**Theo Zervos, Ryan Armendariz-Lopez**

For MPX, we decided to implement a flight tracker app that will alow users to search for specific flights and view data pertaining to them.
When the app is opened, the user is presented with a list of active flights, with each tile of the list presenting:

- Airline
- Arrival Information: Airport, Time
- Departure Information: Airport, Time
